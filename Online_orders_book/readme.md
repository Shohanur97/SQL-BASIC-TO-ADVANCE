I recently completed an SQL assignment where I worked on extracting key insights from a dataset using SQL queries. This project helped me strengthen my skills in data retrieval, aggregation, and analysis.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Used **JOINs** to combine relevant tables for deeper analysis.
- Leveraged **GROUP BY** and **HAVING** to summarize data meaningfully.
- Applied **window functions** for advanced analytical queries.
- Filtered data effectively using **WHERE** and **CASE** statements.


## 🚀 What I Learned
- Writing optimized SQL queries for data analysis.
- Extracting meaningful insights from raw data.
- Structuring queries efficiently for performance.
