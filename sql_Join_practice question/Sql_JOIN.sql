--Question: List all customer names and their corresponding order total amounts, but only for customers who have placed orders.

select c.name,c.city, o.total_amount from customers c
inner join orders o on c.customer_id = o.customer_id;

/*Why INNER JOIN is used here:
Because we want only customers who have placed orders.
That means:
We only want customers who have a match in the Orders table.
We exclude customers with no orders.*/

--2. LEFT JOIN:
--Question: List all customers and their corresponding order amounts. If a customer has not placed any orders, show NULL for the order amount.

select c.name,o.total_amount from
 customers c 
 Left join orders o

/*Why LEFT JOIN?
You want to list all customers â€” whether they placed an order or not.
The order amount exists only if a customer placed an order.
For customers with no matching order, we still want their names to appear â€” and show NULL for the order amount.

 Why This Works:
The LEFT JOIN includes all customers.
If a customer has no matching order, order_amount will be NULL.
So, we filter where order_amount IS NULL.

Question: List all orders and the corresponding customer names. 
If an order is not associated with a customer, show NULL for the customer name.*/

/* Why RIGHT JOIN is used here:
This question says:
Include all orders, even if they donâ€™t have a matching customer.
If an order has no customer, show NULL for the customer name.

What does RIGHT JOIN do?
It returns all rows from the right table (Orders), and the matching rows from the left table (Customers).
If there's no matching customer, the customer_name will be NULL.*/


4. FULL OUTER JOIN:
Question: List all customers and orders, 
including customers who haven't placed any orders and orders with no customer.
Show only the rows where either the customer or the order is missing â€” i.e., only unmatched records (both sides don't match).

/* 4 Why Use FULL OUTER JOIN?
A FULL OUTER JOIN combines the results of:
LEFT JOIN (all customers, even if no orders)
RIGHT JOIN (all orders, even if no customer)
This ensures that:
All customers are included (even if they never ordered).
All orders are included (even if there's no matching customer, e.g., due to bad/missing customer_id).

What We Need:
From a FULL OUTER JOIN, we want only the unmatched rows â€” that means:
Customers who have no orders (order_id IS NULL)
Orders that have no matching customer (customer_id IS NULL from customers) */


/*5. CROSS JOIN:
Question: List every customer with every product, showing all possible combinations of customers and products.

âœ… Why Use CROSS JOIN?
A CROSS JOIN returns the Cartesian product of two tables:
Every row from the first table is combined with every row from the second table.
Itâ€™s used when you want all possible combinations between two sets.

ðŸ§  In This Case:
You want to pair:
Every customer (from customers table)
With every product (from products table)
Regardless of whether a customer has purchased a product or not.

/* 
6. INNER JOIN with 3 Tables:
Question: Show order details including the customer name, product name, and quantity ordered.

âœ… Why Use INNER JOIN Here?
You're combining data from three related tables:
Orders â€“ contains customer_id, product_id, quantity
Customers â€“ to get the customer name
Products â€“ to get the product name

Since you only want matching data (i.e., valid orders with valid customer and product references), you use INNER JOIN to:

Include only rows where the foreign keys (customer_id, product_id) have matches in their respective tables

Avoid showing incomplete or orphaned data

âœ… Question:
Find orders that don't have any associated customer information (i.e., orders where customer info is missing).

ðŸ§  Why Use RIGHT JOIN + NULL Filter?
ðŸŽ¯ Goal:
You want to find orders that exist in the Orders table, but the customer info is missing â€” possibly due to:
Data entry errors
Deleted or corrupted customer records
Foreign key mismatch
